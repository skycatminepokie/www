# Mclogs Uploader

A small Discord bot I made to upload attachments to <https://mclo.gs/>. Helpful when you are on mobile and can't see
attachments, or on desktop and an attachment is too big. Only works for text. See [TOS](./tos.md) and
[Privacy Policy](./privacy.md) (don't worry, they're simple).

Source code is on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/skycatminepokie/mclogs-uploader). You can add it
[on discord](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1463603240133201961) (either as a user app or a server app).
Right-click on a message (long press on mobile) and select "Apps" to get started.
